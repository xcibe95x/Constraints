# Constraints
Constraints is a 3rd Person frenetic Indie Video Game, Developed only by me, and with small helps of friends and people.


## Important: Constraints is not opensource, however, this github page is used to report issues on upcoming Alpha Releases

This will also used for future API and stuff that will eventually be open sourced.

Thank you for patience as i'm alone working on this it will require a lot of time.
